# ðŸŽ‚ Cake Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project showcases a complete machine learning workflow to predict the price of cakes. Using a dataset that includes features like ingredient cost, size, and design complexity, a Random Forest Regressor is trained to provide accurate price estimates.

### Project Highlights

  - **High Accuracy**: Achieves a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE), with predictions being off by only \~$15 on average.
  - **Full ML Pipeline**: Covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
  - **Ethical Consideration**: Proactively removes the `Gender` feature to prevent potential bias in pricing.
  - **Technology**: Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.

## \#\# Project Objective

The primary goal is to build a robust regression model that can accurately predict the price of a cake based on its various attributes. This serves as a practical application of machine learning for a real-world business problem.

-----

## \#\# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains 4,000 entries with the following features:

  - **Sold\_On**: The day of the week the cake was sold.
  - **Size**: The size of the cake (small, medium, large).
  - **Ingredients\_Cost**: The cost of the raw materials.
  - **Design\_Complexity**: Whether the design is simple or complex.
  - **Time\_Taken**: The time in hours required to bake and decorate the cake.
  - **Amount**: The quantity of similar cakes in the same order.
  - **Price**: The final price of the cake (the target variable).

## \#\# Methodology

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: The dataset was loaded and checked for missing values (none were found). The `Gender` column was removed as it showed no correlation with price and could introduce bias.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visual analysis revealed key insights:

      * A very strong positive correlation (**0.91**) exists between `Ingredients_Cost` and `Price`.
      * `Time_Taken` also has a strong positive correlation with `Price`.
      * Prices clearly increase with `Size` and `Design_Complexity`.

3.  **Feature Engineering**: Categorical features were converted into a numerical format suitable for the model:

      * **Ordinal Encoding**: The `Size` feature (`small`, `medium`, `large`) was mapped to numerical values (0, 1, 2) to preserve its inherent order.
      * **One-Hot Encoding**: Nominal features like `Sold_On` and `Design_Complexity` were converted into binary columns.

4.  **Model Training**: A **Random Forest Regressor** was chosen for its high accuracy and ability to handle non-linear relationships. The model was trained on 80% of the dataset.

## \#\# Results & Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated on the remaining 20% of the data (the test set) with impressive results:

| Metric                      | Value       |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | **\~$14.88** |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** | **\~$18.84** |

The **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** indicates that, on average, the model's price predictions are off by only about **$14.88**. This is a highly accurate result considering the price range in the dataset.
